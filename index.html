							<p>Junior Front End Developer role within the Digital Team, working in an Agile environment. Managing the website is at the core

							accessibility needs and cross-browser compatibility challenges. Using Umbraco as a CMS within the ASP.Net MVC environment, I usually 
							write code in HTML5, SASS and Jquery/Javascript to meet the design Team and the stakeholders needs.</p>

							<p>Front-end development and SEO internship using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. Mainly I worked on the Company’s main website improving 
							the development code and the design, designed and created the Careers and Competitions pages and worked on the Homepage, introducing an Instagram 
							feed slider among others (using Magento CMS). I revisited the Company’s Blog page improving the general design and making it more consistent 
							with the Company’s website (using WordPress CMS). I also wrote the Company’s Ebay homepage following the main website design as well as few 
							other projects. Besides my frontend tasks, I learned some SEO techniques to boost the website visibility and improve search engines ranking.</p>
